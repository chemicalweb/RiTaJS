PROBLEM: need to make one version of run-in-qunit.sh

mkdir structure in RJS/build  ?

node
  rita
    lib
    test (move here)
    scripts (move here)

move:
  lib/rita.js ->  from RJS/www/download/rita-XXX.js (better from build?)
  test/*.* -> from RJS/test
  (test|scripts)/phantomjs -> from tools
  (test|scripts)/run-in-qunit.js -> from HERE ??
  package.json -> from RJS (Or HERE)
  README.MD -> from RJS (Or HERE)
  
update:
  package.json (check version #)
  

npm publish  (from inside node/rita)
