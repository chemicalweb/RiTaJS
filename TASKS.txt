////////////////////////// OLD NOTES (from questions.txt) ///////////////////////////////////
	
THE BIG PICTURE:

-- Namespaces (and structure for private/public/static vars, constants, methods)  
-- Subclassing from external .js files
-- File-loading (reduce # of files to load from html?)
-- Grammars, support loading multiple grammars (by name)

RiText:
    
  -- Animations: 
  	  -- there is a strange bug where the interpolation causes a big jump in values and a flash **
      -- Need to add delay to animations
      
RiGrammar:

  -- We need to be able to load multiple grammars in one sketch
  
  -- Would be great to only specify the file name in one place (not sure if we can do this)
  
  -- Can we dynamically create a variable (named) from a string passed into the constructor?  
  
General:  

  -- What about putting the constants in RiTa, instead of RC? 
     So Users type RiTa.FOO_BAR (See move-to.js)                  
               
  -- Private methods: where should these go? Feels weird to put them at the top
     level closure, when they apply only to one class...     
       
       
-------------

  -- Where do RiText's go when no position is specified, can we center them in the window?   FIXED (DH)
  
  -- Multiple sets of TextBehaviors ?
  
  -- fadeIn() seems to be broken ??													FIXED (DH)
  
  -- setColor()/fill() is broken on 1 & 2 arguments                 				FIXED (DH)
  
  -- motion-types are not passed to move behaviors                 				  	FIXED (DH)
  
RiLexicon:
  -- Won't load  ("rita_dict_json.js:5023SyntaxError: Parse error")					FIXED(DH)
  

	DOCS TO ADD:

	  /** Specifies person as one of (first, scond or third) */
	  public static final int FIRST_PERSON = 1;
	  
	  /** Specifies person as one of (first, scond or third) */
	  public static final int SECOND_PERSON = 2;
	  
	  /** Specifies person as one of (first, scond or third) */
	  public static final int THIRD_PERSON = 3;
	  
	  /** Specifies tense as one of (past, present or future) */
	  public static final int PAST_TENSE = 4;
	  
	  /** Specifies tense as one of (past, present or future) */
	  public static final int PRESENT_TENSE = 5;
	  
	  /** Specifies tense as one of (past, present or future) */
	  public static final int FUTURE_TENSE = 6;
	  
	  /** Specifies agreement as one of (singular or plural) */
	  public static final int SINGULAR = 7;  
	  
	  /** Specifies agreement as one of (singular or plural) */
	  public static final int PLURAL = 8;

	CHANGE: RiText.protoype.visible() -> RiText.protoype.isVisible() [DONE]
	   
	/* FROM RITA.js file */
	
  TODO:
 
  -- remove dependency for 1 function (getMetrics()) on jquery...
            
    -- add memoizing of functions: textWidth, textAscent, textDescent, getBoundingBox, etc
        -- fonts and bounds
    
    -- re-add requestAnimationFrame?
 
   RiTa:
        splitSentences(): Can't use the lib from java for sentence parsing.
            Implemented a simple regex. What's a better alternative?

    RiText: 

        Make sure that color() takes numbers AND strings (e.g., 'black' or '#ffee23');
        Add: rotateTo(radians, sec) 

    RiLexicon:
        Need to better deal with words not found in dictionary (getStresses, getPhonemes, getSyllables)
        Finish: Get-random-word-by-part-of-speech

    Conjugator:
        Why are irregulars not accurate? Sleep is returning "sleeped" not "slept"
            Why is it apparently only reaching two types of rules?
            
    Add: RiHTMLParser / Google Search / MsNgramClient
        fetch()
        fetchImage()
        Google search
