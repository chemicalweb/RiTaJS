### <a href="http://rednoise.org/rita/js">The RiTaJS website</a>

RiTaJS is an easy-to-use toolkit designed to facilitate experiments 
in natural language and generative literature, based on the RiTa 
(http://rednoise.org/rita) library for Java. Like the original RiTa, RiTaJS 
works alone or in conjunction with Processing(JS) and/or with 
its own Canvas renderer, and/or as a NodeJS module.  All RiTaJS tools
are free and open-source.
