PROBLEM: need to make one version of run-in-qunit.sh

mkdir structure in RJS/build  ?

node
  rita
    lib
    test
    scripts

move:
  lib/rita.js ->  from RJS/www/download/rita-XXX.js (better from build?)
  test/*.* -> from RJS/test
  test/phantomjs -> from tools
  test/run-in-qunit.js -> from HERE ??
  package.json -> from RJS
  README.MD -> from RJS
  





npm publish
