A small crowd gathered and whispered to one another, as though the lizard would understand them if they spoke in normal voices. The lizard seemed not even a little perturbed by their gathering. It drank and drank, its long forked tongue was like a red river hypnotizing the people, keeping them in a trance-like state. 'It's like a different town,' one of them whispered. 'Change is good,' the other one whispered back.";
